This repository contains some simulations of navigation in unknown enviroments using logGPIS. 

TO DOs:
	- Add moving obstacles
	- Add agent dynamic
	- Use control barrier function to avoid obstacles
	- Add a planner
	- Test 3D enviroments
	- Implement GJK algorithm to query the EDF field from generic convex shapes
